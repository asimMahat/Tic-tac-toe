A simple tic-tac-toe game

Tic-tac-toe ,noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. Here i  have written a python program to play the game in console/terminal.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.The above code doesnt need any libraries,could be run if python is installed in your system.
